Further explanation is contained in the BLM Instruction Memorandum No. 2014085 (April 23, 2014), available on the BLM's website al hflps:// www.blm.gov/poliey/im-2014-085.

 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuan to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality regulations, the BLM announced its intent to prepare an RMP Amendmenl and associated EIS on February 25, 2014 [79 FR 10548]. On October 21, 2016, the BLM and the BlA published an amended Notice of Intent in the Federal Register announcing the addition of the BLA as a joint/co-lead agency for the EIS (81 FR 72819). The purpose of the EIS was to analyze the impacts of additional oil and gas development within the San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico, as well as decisions related to lands and realty, BLM-managed lands with wildermess characteristics, and vegetation management. The EIS was also to evaluate alternatives and issues related to the BLA's authority over mineral leasing and associated activity decisions on Navajo Tribal Trust Lands and Navajo Indian allotments. The Notice of Availability for the Draft EIS published in the Federal Register on February 28, 2020 (85 FR 12012). The bureaus distributed the Draft EIS to various Federal, State, and local agencies, elected officials, special interest groups, interested individuals, and the media. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions placed on inperson meetings, virtual public hearings were held on May 14, 15, 16, and 18. 2020, as well as on August 26, 27, 28, and29.2020.Since the initial publication of the Notices of Intent in 2014 and 2016, and the publicalion of the draft RMP Amendment and EIS in 2020, there have been many changes relevant to the plan amendmenl and associated EIS, such as a change in the development trends in the San Juan Basin; the withdrawal of 336,404 acres from mineral entry around the Chaco Culture National Historical Park; the preparation of BLA-funded ethnographic studies for the region; the establishrment of the Honoring Chaco Initiative: and an increase in outdoor recreation in the region. Given these changes and the extent of revisions necessary to address these changes in the current EIS process, the agencies determined it is impractical to continue the plan amendment effort as currently structured.Therefore, the BLM and BLA hereby terminate preparation of the EIS for the RMP Amendment.
