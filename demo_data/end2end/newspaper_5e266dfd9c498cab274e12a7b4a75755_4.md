**SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:** Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality regulations, the BLM announced its intent to prepare an EIS for the Farmington and associated RMP on February 25, 2014 (79 FR 10548). On October 21, 2016, the BLM and the BIA published an amended Notice of Intent in the Federal Register announcing the addition of the BIA as a joint lead agency for the EIS (81 FR 72718). The purpose of the EIS was to analyze impacts of additional oil and gas development within the San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico, as well as decisions related to lands and realty, BLM-managed lands with wilderness characteristics, and wildlife management. The EIS was also to evaluate alternatives and issues related to the BIA’s authority over mineral leasing and associated energy decisions on Navajo Tribal Trust lands and Navajo Nation allotments. The Notice of Availability for the Draft EIS published in the Federal Register on February 28, 2020 (85 FR 12012). The bureaus distributed the Draft EIS to various Federal, State, and local agencies, elected officials, special interest groups, interested individuals, and the media. Due to the COVID–19 pandemic and restrictions placed on in-person meetings, four public hearings were held on May 14, 15, 16, and 18, 2020, as well as on August 26, 27, 28, and 29, 2020. Since the close of the public comment period in August 2020, and due to the publication of the draft RMP Amendment and EIS in 2020, there have been many changes relevant to the plan amendment and associated EIS, such as a change in the amount of oil and gas leasing and development in the San Juan Basin. The withdrawal of 336,400 acres from primary mineral production under the Northern DPA through the comprehensive update to the BLM’s onshore oil and gas leasing program; the establishment of new resources conservation areas and other changes not stated. In response to these changes and the observations resulting from the public hearings, the agencies determined it would be beneficial to continue the plan amendment as currently structured. Therefore, the BLM and BIA hereby terminate preparation of the EIS for the RMP Amendment.
